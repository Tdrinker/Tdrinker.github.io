    <p> My name is Ge Gao and I am 19 years old. I am currently studying
      math and computer science at Tufts university. My dad was in the navy (who
      's currently retired now)so my earlier education (or pre-school education) 
      was all about following rules and being strict to myself. My mom works in an
      American bank and taught me English when I was little.

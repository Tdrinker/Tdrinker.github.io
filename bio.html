    <br>

    <div id = "Bio_story"> My name is Ge Gao and I am 19 years old. I am currently studying math and computer science at Tufts university. My dad was in the navy (who
    's currently retired now)so my earlier education (or pre-school education) 
    was all about following rules and being strict to myself. My mom works in an
    American bank and taught me English when I was little.

    <div id = "Bio_story"> "That's enough!" I shouted at my father and his business associates.<br><br> "He doesn't want to drink anymore!" I said sternly in defense of my father, who but a moment ago was about to consume his eighth glass of rice wine. The pain on his face told me he needed help, and if he didn't feel he could say no, then I would say it for him. <br><br>Only later did my father take me aside and explain that each toast was a sign of respect, and declining a toast is impolite. He told me that in China it is customary to consume large amounts of alcohol as a mechanism to create trust and begin business relationships. <br><br> Why? That doesn't make sense. <br><br> The aforementioned situation is the first recollection of my curiosity and confrontation dealing with the balance between tradition and progress. From that point forward, I have always thought to myself, "why", when confronted with things that don't make logical sense such as watching my father consume dangerous amounts of alcohol. Such an attitude is not an easy one to maintain in a land where tradition is so often the justification. <br><br> My curiosity on why has sometimes created tensions between me and my teachers. After all, in Chinese educational system, knowledge is not always something to be obtained through understanding but passed down without question. Why? Because that's just how we do it. Unsatisfied with such answers, I sometimes struggled to accept information that my teachers, parents and elders tried to instill in me. I felt like I was fighting the whole world in my quest to understand why. <br><br>In middle school I had a teacher who quickly became familiar with my inquisitive form of challenge and embraced it. His interest in helping every student go on their own intellectual journey was perfect for my curiosities; when I tried to understand why, he would reply, "Why not?" <br><br> When we talked through a deeper understanding on subjects, he would point to scientific studies that explained my curiosities, while affirming my passion for truth by praising my need for deeper understanding "We need more students to question knowledge", he told me. <br><br>He also taught me an important lesson on how to express opinions and thoughts, "don't be combative, be collaborative". For the rest of the semester, and even outside of class, we continued our regular discussions. He taught me how to express ideas in a more collegial way and that debating is as much about listening as it is about speaking. With these invaluable lessons I entered high school.<br><br>While I had smoothed the edges of my rhetoric, my enthusiasm remained. <br><br> I was pleased to find that I wasn't alone in my style of inquiry. As high school progressed, friendships were formed by like-minded students-we were held together by learning and inquiry. Like me, they appreciated the challenge of reasoning and rationalizing logical conclusions, sharing of ideas and defending them, and listening to ideas and challenging them. And so it went, our unofficial group of critical thinkers measured the world around us with our inquiries and doubts, colliding with traditional wisdom to create a richer experience. <br><br> The critical thinking skill I was introduced to in middle school has become a permanent lens through which I see the strengths and weaknesses of anything in this world, including long-standing traditions. For me, it is the most valuable part of my learning and the one that helps me make sense of the world and how I fit into it. <br><br> No longer the careless boy who abrasively challenged all information, I am now a mature young man seeking to further my education via dialogue, debate and finding truths that will build a better and more logical world. I want to solve problems that haven't even been found yet, and I am grateful for both the frustrations and positive experiences that reinforced my sense of purpose from learning.
